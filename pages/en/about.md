I graduated from the Military Academy in 2003 as a "Systems Engineer". From a young age, I was constantly interested in electronics and computers. Between 2016-2018, I worked as a _Data Analyst_ at the Land Forces Command. In September 2018, I retired due to health issues. After deciding to do something where I can use my interests and knowledge, I started my master's degree in _Multimedia Computing_ at the Informatics Institute of Middle East Technical University in the Fall Semester of 2016 and completed it in 2019. After retirement, I served as Technical Manager of the Data Science Department at DataBoss Information and Security. During this duty, I managed many different projects in the fields of computer vision, spatio-temporal prediction, natural language processing, and also did development work in some of them. Between April 2020 - April 2022, I worked as a data scientist at ARINLABS Artificial Intelligence Technologies. Currently, I work as Software Development Team Leader at Signatrix GmbH.
